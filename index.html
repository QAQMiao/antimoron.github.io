	<p>You are the player, reading words...</p>
	<p>Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive</p>
	<p>You. You. You are alive.</p>
	<p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees</p>
	<p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the light that fell from the crisp night sky of winter, where a fleck of light in the corner of the player's eye might be a star a million times as massive as the sun, boiling its planets to plasma in order to be visible for a moment to the player, walking home at the far side of the universe, suddenly smelling food, almost at the familiar door, about to dream again</p>
	<p>and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream</p>
	<p>and the universe said I love you</p>
	<p>and the universe said you have played the game well</p>
	<p>and the universe said everything you need is within you</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are stronger than you know</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are the daylight</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are the night</p>
	<p>and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you</p>
	<p>and the universe said the light you seek is within you</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are not alone</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing</p>
	<p>and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code</p>
	<p>and the universe said I love you because you are love.</p>
	<p>And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.</p>
	<p>You are the player.</p>
	<p>Wake up.</p>

			<p>That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is deep in the dream of a game.</p>
			<p>Words make a wonderful interface. Very flexible. And less terrifying than staring at the reality behind the screen.</p>
			<p>They used to hear voices. Before players could read. Back in the days when those who did not play called the players witches, and warlocks. And players dreamed they flew through the air, on sticks powered by demons.</p>
			<p>What did this player dream?</p>
			<p>This player dreamed of sunlight and trees. Of fire and water. It dreamed it created. And it dreamed it destroyed. It dreamed it hunted, and was hunted. It dreamed of shelter.</p>
			<p>Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?</p>
			<p>Sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yes.</p>
			<p>But there are times it is sad, in the long dream. It creates worlds that have no summer, and it shivers under a black sun, and it takes its sad creation for reality.</p>
			<p>Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.</p>
